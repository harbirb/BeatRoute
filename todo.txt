- Don't worry about UI for now


ASYNCSTORAGE IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO TRACK ONBOARDING STATUS, THE LOGIC FOR IS-STRAVACONNECTED DOES NOT WORK

- update the name to sticka
- customize fonts/styles of text stickers
- Rendering stickers off screen at higher resolution before copying to clipboard
- Cleaner login page and logic
    - use google sign in if possible
- More robust logic for strava/spotify connections
- Make the settings page
